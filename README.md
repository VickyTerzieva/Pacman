# Pacman
This project is going to represent the classical pacman game - the player is going to eat pac-dots,
move around a maze, there will be ghosts that will chase him and if they eat him he loses a life;
he will be capable of eating them - if he has eaten a big pac-dot he will have a few seconds to eat them
(they change their color and they have to return to their home so that they revive). There will be bonus 
life at 10 000 points (the player will have 3 in the beginning), I will also make a high score board. The game
ends when all lives of the player are lost (or he reaches the final, 256, level).
